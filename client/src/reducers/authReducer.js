//Reducers determine what and how the data is written into the store
//isAuthenticated to keep track across the board if the user logged in or not
//if the user is authenticated, who is the user.. this information really helps to keep track of
//the user among all components
//reducer is a function that returns the data which is written into the store
//return statement inside a reducer means it is writing the data to the redux store
